{"data": " # EASYRPC\n High availability rpc framework ,easy to use. \n \n # Features\n - Both synchronize and asynchronize is allowed register to server.\n - Both synchronize and asynchronize call method is provided by the client.\n - High performance & low latency with async preforked module.\n - Supported for both pypy and cpython 36up version on Linux and Windows platform.\n - Distributed notice service supported by etcd.(Under development.\n - Some more black magics.\n \n # Installation\n \n\n```\npip3 install git+https://github.com/NCNU-OpenSource/testrepo.git\n```\n> Notification : Currently continuous integration not activated , reliability might be limited.\n\n # Get started\n \n > Notification : since distributed support is still under development , only easy mode (no support from etcd) is allowed in current version.\n \n To get started , you may create a rpc server like this\n ```Python3\n # server.py\n from easyrpc import *\n import asyncio\n \n s = rpc_server(port = 25000)\n \n @s.register()\n def test(n):\n     return n+1\n \n # standard startover with standard asyncio api , easy to control\n asyncio.run(s.start_serving())\n ```\n \\* if you're using pypy or python version 3.6 ,you may need to pass eventloop explicitly like this:\n ```\n loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n loop.run_until_complete(s.start_serving(loop))\n ```\n \nThen you may create a client file like this:<br>\nwhich allows you to call whatever function you have registered in your server.\n```Python3\n# client.py\nfrom easyrpc import *\n\nc = rpc_client(port = 25000)\n\nret = c.test(1)\nprint(ret) ; assert ret == 2\n```\n# Usage\nQuick view about advanced features:\n- You can register both synchronize and asynchronize functions ,they will all behave asynchronizely as service.\n- You can use prefork method to improve handling capacity.\n- When register you can use `maximum_flow:int` to control overall flow capability of each function registered.\n- `unstable_network:bool` helps you control if your server need to maintain a datastructure preventing repeated execute cause by network fluctuation ,  which may reduce performanceor , just resend call when request failed.\n```Python3\n# server.py\nfrom easyrpc import *\n\ns = rpc_server(port = 25000)\n\n@s.register()\nasync def fib_async(n):\n    a , b = 0 , 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        a , b = b , a + b\n    return a\n\n@s.register(maximum_flow = 100)\ndef fib_sync(n):\n    if n<2:\n        return n\n    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n\ns.prefork(bindcore = False)\nasyncio.run(s.start_serving())\n```\n`bindcore:bool` binds each process to a cpu core specifily which helps reduce cache miss ,but limits the flexibility of kernel's tasks scheduling .Default False.\n\n> Notification: since fork copy memory space as the same from parent to child process , where you fork matters . For example ,if you fork before register function ,then each function will have its own process lock. Fork *IS NOT* supported on windows.\n\n- Both synchronize and asynchronize method is offered by client ,use `sync:bool` to control.\n```Python3\n# client_demo2.py\nfrom easyrpc import *\nimport asyncio\nimport time\n\nc = rpc_client(port = 25000)\n\n# This function blocks until answer returns back\nassert c.fib_async(1, sync = True) == None \n\nasync def main():\n    start_time = time.time()\n    tasks = (c.fib_async(i) for i in range(1000))\n    ret = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)   # you can make multiple \\\n                                         # requests at the same time. \n    print(f\"Get {len(ret)} results ,for last three result  \\\n          shows {ret[-3:]} ,takes time {time.time()-start_time}s.\")\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n- sync functions registered whill be running in process pool , since it takes a long communicating time(about 1ms) , make sure if you could get more time back when you call it. The following example shows that with this frame work you can take advantage of multi cores.\n```Python3\n# client_demo3.py\nfrom easyrpc import *\nfrom multiprocessing import cpu_count\nimport asyncio , time\n\nc = rpc_client(port = 25000)\n\nasync def main():\n    start_time_1 = time.time()\n    ret1 = await c.fib_sync(30)\n    end_time_1 = time.time()\n    ret2 = await asyncio.gather((c.fib_sync(30) for i in range(cpu_count())))\n    end_time_2 = time.time()\n    assert ret2 == [ret1] * cpu_count()\n    print(f\"Single call takes time {end_time_1 - start_time}s while {cpu_count()} \\\n          times call takes {end_time_2 - end_time_1}s\")\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n# Some more magic.\nPickle is a magic library python provides serialize service ,which is a stack describe language in essence. It maks it possible to share high level objects between process ,however it's low performance comparing to msgpack and not secure against erroneous maliciously constructed data.\nPickle protocol is defaultly disabled in easyrpc.\nFor flaxible use ,pickle can help us dealing with server's own data structure bu sending ape. \n\n```Python3\nfrom easyrpc import *\nimport asyncio ,os\n\nc = rpc_client(port = 25000)\n\nfunc = lambda x ,y:(os.system('clear') ,print(\"This is a magic!\") , x**2 + y)\nassistant = c.magicwarp(func) # warp function to a magic assistant object\nret = c.magiccall(assistant)(11 , 10) # with help of assistant ,magic call returns a callable.\nassert ret == [None , None , 131]\n```\nYou will suprizingly relize that console of server.py has been changed.\n\n# API Reference\nDocumentation of exposed interfaces\n#### Class : rpc_server(\\[host:str , port:int , allow_pickle:bool , unstable_network:bool\\])\nCreate a rpc server.\n* ##### Parameters:\n    - host ,port : Location to bind server.\n    - allow_pickle : Allow magic call or user level pickle protocol ,in consideration of security you should only allow this option in a reliable environment.
